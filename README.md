##Abstract:
In this project, we have designed and developed a smart dustbin using an ultrasonic sensor, Arduino microcontroller, and servo motor. The aim of this project is to provide an efficient and automated waste management system that can help in keeping the environment clean and hygienic. The ultrasonic sensor detects the presence of waste in the dustbin and triggers the servo motor to open the lid, allowing the user to dispose of the waste. The dustbin lid automatically closes after the waste has been deposited, making the system completely hands-free.

##Introduction:
The increase in population has led to a significant rise in waste generation, which has become a significant environmental issue. The traditional waste management system involves manually opening the dustbin lid to dispose of the waste, which can be unhygienic and inefficient. To address this issue, we have developed a smart dustbin that can automatically open and close the lid using an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor.
The ultrasonic sensor uses sound waves to detect the presence of waste in the dustbin. When the sensor detects waste, it sends a signal to the Arduino microcontroller, which in turn activates the servo motor. The servo motor opens the lid of the dustbin, allowing the user to dispose of the waste. Once the waste has been deposited, the servo motor automatically closes the lid, making the system completely hands-free.
The smart dustbin has several advantages over traditional dustbins. It is more hygienic as there is no need to touch the lid to open or close it. It is also more efficient as it automatically opens and closes the lid, reducing the time and effort required to dispose of waste. The system is also eco-friendly as it encourages proper waste management and helps in keeping the environment clean.

##Methodology:
1.	Design and prototyping: The first step in this project was to design the smart dustbin system. The design includes the physical layout of the dustbin, the ultrasonic sensor, the Arduino microcontroller, and the servo motor. A prototype was then created to test the design and make necessary modifications.
2.	Assembly and connection: Once the design was finalized, the components were assembled, and the necessary connections were made. The ultrasonic sensor was connected to the Arduino board, and the servo motor was connected to the Arduino output pins.
3.	Programming: The next step was to program the Arduino microcontroller to control the servo motor based on the readings from the ultrasonic sensor. The code was written in Arduino IDE and uploaded to the microcontroller.
4.	Testing and calibration: After programming, the system was tested for its functionality and accuracy. The ultrasonic sensor was calibrated to ensure that it accurately detected the presence of waste and triggered the servo motor to open the dustbin lid.
5.	System integration: Once the system was tested and calibrated, it was integrated into the smart dustbin. The servo motor was attached to the dustbin lid made of cardboard, and the ultrasonic sensor was mounted on the wall of the dustbin.
6.	Final testing: The final step was to test the complete system to ensure that it operated as intended. The smart dustbin was tested, and the lid was observed to open and close automatically based on the ultrasonic sensor readings.
